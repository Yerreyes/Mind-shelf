🧠 A personal content management web app built with Next.js.

This is a personal project in which I am putting my Next.js knowledge into practice.

I am developing the first phase, which helps you track, organize, and reflect on the content you consume—like books, videos, and movies a clean and intuitive interface.You can add articles and publish reviews.

🚀 Project Goal
The main goal is to create a modular and scalable personal dashboard where users can:
  Add items they've read, watched, or studied.
  Attach personal notes and opinions.
  View all content in a Netflix-style swiper layout.
  Keep track of what they’ve learned or want to revisit.

🛠️ Tech Stack 
It is a full-stack development.
  Frontend: Next.js (React-based)
  Styling: CSS Modules
  Database: Prisma + PostgreSQL
  Architecture: Modular + Fullstack (via Next.js API Routes)

📅 Status
Currently in active development. The focus is on making the app functional, clean, and intuitive—prioritizing a solid core over features.
